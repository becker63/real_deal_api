# We are defining a custom plug here
# It stores logged in users in a map
# TODO: modify this to use more pattern matching
# TODO: for some reason the original code that mentor gave me doesnt work.. so thanks gpt
# SOLVED TODO /\: This part of the app is very weird, according to gpt, the previous account_id = get_session(conn, :account_id) code that mentor wrote is only supposed to look at cookies. This is despite the fact that he definetly did not do that with the api test he showed. This is also confirmed by the docs: https://hexdocs.pm/plug/Plug.Conn.html#module-session-vs-assigns. Sooo.. this is fine for now.
